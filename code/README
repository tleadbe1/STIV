The basic sctructure of the capsule:

/code/DynamicsSolvers 

This directory contains python class definitions which carry the information necessary to run Langevin and stiv(Eyink) simulations. It has a version for a single particle in a quadratic potential (used in Fig2) and one for N particles in a mass spring chain where the springs are double welled interactions. 

Each of the remaining direcories (eg /code/Fig2/ ... ) contains code to reproduce the corresponding figure. 

In this base directory,  "run" is called to initiate all simulations and analysis. It really only calls runEverything.sh which in turn enters the Fig* directories and runs everything else. Find specific README's in each of the Fig* directories for more information.
