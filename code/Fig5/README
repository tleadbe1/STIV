The directory Linear17 holds information to run simulations of 17 masses. Linear62 holds information to run simulations of 62 masses. 

To run all simulations in Linear17, execute:

bash runAllSim.sh

in the Linear17 directory. Each of the subdirectories is labeled by the pulling velocity (V2 corresponds to v = 2, and V1_8 corresponds to v = 1/8 etc.). To compute information about the velocity of the interface, run 

python3.8 getFrontVel.py

in the Linear17 directory. To compute the viscous dissipation in each simulation, run 

python3.8 getVisDiss.py 

in the Linear17 directory. Data produced this way will be stored in the VelData and VisDissData directories respectively. 

To run the 62 mass simulations, enter the Linear62/V1 directory and run 

python3.8 runX0.py
python3.8 runSimSplit.py

------

Once all simulations have been run and the front velocity and viscous dissipation data computed, one can run 

python3.8 plotAll.py 

from the Fig5 directory. This will produce Fig5.pdf.
