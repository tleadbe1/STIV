Fig4 can be generated simply by executing:

bash runAll.sh

Each of the firectories holds the information for one of the pulling protocols. 
Each contains an inputs.py file with all of the simulation parameters, 
a runX0.py file which reads the inputs.py and runs an initialization Langevin simulation to get equilibrated initial data,
a runSims.py file which runs the main Langevin and STIV simulations, and a computeThermo.py file which uses the data from
the main simulation run to compute thermodynamics quantities. 

This data is then compiled and plotted by plot.py in this directory.
